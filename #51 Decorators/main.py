# what is decorator ?

# A decorator takes a function and inserts some new functionality in it without changing the function itself. A reference to a function is passed to a decorator, and the decorator returns a modified function. The modified functions usually contain calls to the original function. This is also known as metaprogramming because a part of the program tries to modify and add functionality to another part of the program at compile time.

# what is wrapper ? 
# A wrapper is a function that provides a wrap-around another function While using decorator, all the code executed before our function that we passed as a parameter and the code after it is executed belongs to the wrapper function.


# NOTE  
# A function can be decorated many times. 
# Note that a decorator is called before defining a function.


# There are two ways to write a Python decorator:

# We can pass our function to the decorator as an argument, thus defining a function and passing it to our decorator.
#  We can simply use the @ symbol before the function we’d like to decorate.
