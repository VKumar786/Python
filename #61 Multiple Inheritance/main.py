# "In multiple inheritance, a class is derived from more than one class i.e. multiple base classes. The child class, in this case, has features of both the parent classes."

# Override means having two methods that have the same name
#  when the same method defined in the parent class is also defined in the child class, the process is known as Method overriding

# rules in orverride

# The name of the child method should be the same as parents.
# Inheritance should be there, and we need to derive a child class from a parent class
# Both of their parameters should be the same.
