# only theory explain 

# Abstraction refers to hiding unnecessary details to focus on the whole product instead of parts of the project separately

# In simple words, abstraction can be achieved by hiding the background details and showing only the necessary ones. In programming, abstraction can not be achieved without Encapsulation.

# Encapsulation means hiding under layers

# Abstraction focuses on the working of the object instead of the how part, while Encapsulation is all about hiding the way or method of working and just providing the working model.

# Abstraction
#   Its application is during the design level.
# Abstraction is used to solve the problem and issues that arise at the design stage.
# Abstraction focuses on what the object does instead of how the details are implemented.
#  Abstraction can be implemented by using Interface and Abstract Class.

# Encapsulation
# Its application is during the Implementation level.
# Encapsulation is used to solve the problem and issue that arise at the implementation stage.
# Encapsulation focuses on hiding the code and data into a single unit to secure the data from the outside world.
# Encapsulation can be implemented using Access Modifiers (Public, Protected, and Private.)
