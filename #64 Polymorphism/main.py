# Polymorphism
# The same object or thing changing its state from one form to another is known as polymorphic.It occurs mostly with base and derived classes. basic talking about it is a theortical topic but have a mean of oops

#  For example, suppose a method in the child class has the same name as the methods in the parent class
# then the order will be 
# instance of child
# instance of parent
# static of child
# static of parent 

print(len('vishal kumar'))
print(len([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]))

# Python also implements Polymorphism using methods. The len() method returns the length of an object. In this case, the function len() is polymorphic as it is taking a string as input in the first case, which returns the total length/characters of the string, and in the second case, it is taking list as input.



# Polymorphism in '+' operator:-
print(5+5)
print('vishal'+' khan sir')



# main concept of classes are to implement

# abstraction (hiding unnecessary details from the user)
# encapulsation || Encapsulation (hiding under layers)
# polymorphism (operator overloading)
# Inhertiance (single Inheritance | multiple Inheritance | multilevel Inheritance)
