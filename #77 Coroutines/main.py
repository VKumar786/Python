'''
Coroutines --> 
    it is the concept that 
        at the first it will take the time to load the file 
        but on the secound go it will start from a particular point in the function
               
Basic Syntax is :
    def myfunc():
        while True:
            value = (yield)

generator --> they generates the value of the fly
