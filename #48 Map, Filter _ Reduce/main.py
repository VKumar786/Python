'''
filter the list as how many of them are odd and even

if we wanna to change the value of the list item which are even multi 2


  chunck  -->       filter     -->       map       -->       reduce
(raw data)  (only refined data)  (operation on data) (one value out of data)


reduce take two values at a time
