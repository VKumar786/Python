# theory 

# there are two type of argument 

# 1. positional arguments - are the one in which an order
# we have to know about asterisk or more commonly known in Perl 6 and ruby as a splat operator.
# Asterisk is used in python as a mathematical symbol for multiplication, but in case of arguments, it refers to unpacking. The unpacking could be for a list, tuple, or a dictionary. We will discover more about it by defining *args and **kwargs.

# 2. keyword arguments

# Note that the name args does not make any difference, we can use any other name, such as *myargs. The only thing that makes a difference is the Asterisk(*).

# **kwargs is keyword arguments. It passes the data to the argument in the form of a dictionary
