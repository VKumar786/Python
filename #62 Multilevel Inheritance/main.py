#  Multiple inheritance VS. Multilevel inheritance

# Multiple inheritance
# Multiple Inheritance is where a class inherits from more than one base class.
# Sometimes, multiple Inheritance makes the system more complex, thatâ€™s why it is not widely used.
# Multiple Inheritance has two class levels; these are base class and derived class.

# Multilevel inheritance
# In multilevel inheritance, we inherit from a derived class, making that derived class a base class for a new class.
# Multilevel Inheritance is widely used. It is easier to handle code when using multilevel inheritance.
# Multilevel Inheritance has three class levels, which are base class, intermediate class, and derived class.
